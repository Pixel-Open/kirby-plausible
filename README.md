# Plausible for Kirby

This is a custom plugin for Kirby CMS. It adds a plausible page to follow the activity of your website.

You need to have a custom plausible.io link and to add it to your config file with the value pixelopen.plausible.plausibleLink

Some navigator extension may prevent the panel page to be show.

Add the snippet plausible in your templates and/or snippets so plausible.io will receive data of your website activity.

The plugin is only translate in English and French, it also supported in Deutsch but the translation will be done in English.
For other languages, it may has some errors, please add a redirection to either French or English in the index.php file.
